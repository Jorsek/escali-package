        <title>XSLT introduction to the transformation language</title>
        <para>This section shall serve as an introduction to the transformation language XSLT. As already shown in the previous sections, XSLT is essential for the practical work with <?sqf_together start?>XSL-FO<?sqf_together end?>. The following explanations shall help to introduce <?together start?>XSL-FO<?together end?> and to understand the examples and applications in the text. In order to gain a deeper understanding of XSLT with all its facets, the book "Web-Design mit XMLâ€œ ("Web design with XML") by Manfred Knobloch and Matthias Kopp is recommended. This book was also published in the xml.bibliothek series of the publishing company dpunkt-Verlag.</para>
