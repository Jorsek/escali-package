# Escali Oxygen Plugin Help

This help contains a small documentation and sample file suit for the 
[Escali Oxygen Plugin](https://github.com/schematron-quickfix/escali-package#escali-oxygen-plugin).

The sample files are based on a presentation I gave at the

The [documentation folder](documentation/README.md) contains a small documentation of the Escali Plugin.
